1)Feature:
This tutorial focuses on creating secure JAX-WS web service with UsernameToken WS-Security profile by using Metro and WSIT - See more at: http://java.globinch.com/enterprise-java/web-services/jax-ws/secure-usernametoken-java-web-services-using-metro-wsit/#metro-webservice-stack

Please note that, the plain text username and password is used in production 
only when it is combined with SSL or WS-Security encryption. 
That means metro requires either transport-level encryption ( SSL) or other message-level encryption 
to be in use while using this UsernameToken profile. User Name token will be part of SOAP Header 
rather than HTTP header
